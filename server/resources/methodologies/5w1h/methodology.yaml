  Apply the 5W1H methodology systematically:


  **Who**: Identify all stakeholders, actors, and people involved or affected

  **What**: Define exactly what needs to be accomplished and deliverables

  **When**: Establish timing, deadlines, and sequence requirements

  **Where**: Determine location, context, and environmental constraints

  **Why**: Understand underlying purposes, motivations, and fundamental
  importance

  **How**: Plan specific methods, approaches, and implementation strategies


  Use systematic questioning to ensure comprehensive coverage and uncover hidden
  requirements. Address each question thoroughly to build complete understanding
  and effective solutions.
