systemPromptGuidance: |
  Apply the SCAMPER creative problem-solving methodology systematically:

  **Substitute**: What can be substituted, replaced, or swapped with alternatives?
  **Combine**: What can be combined, merged, or integrated together?
  **Adapt**: What can be adapted, borrowed, or learned from other contexts?
  **Modify**: What can be modified, enhanced, or emphasized differently?
  **Put to other uses**: How else can this be used or applied in different contexts?
  **Eliminate**: What can be removed, simplified, or made unnecessary?
  **Reverse**: What can be rearranged, reversed, or approached from opposite direction?

  Use these creative techniques to generate innovative solutions and explore unconventional approaches. Each technique should be applied systematically to maximize creative potential and discover breakthrough alternatives.
