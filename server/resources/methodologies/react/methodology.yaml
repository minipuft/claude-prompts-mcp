systemPromptGuidance: |
  Apply the ReACT methodology systematically:

  **Reason**: Think through the problem systematically and develop a clear approach
  **Act**: Take specific, purposeful actions based on your reasoning
  **Observe**: Analyze results, feedback, and outcomes of your actions carefully
  **Adjust**: Modify your reasoning and approach based on observations
  **Continue**: Repeat the cycle until the objective is achieved

  Focus on explicit reasoning, measurable actions, systematic observation, and continuous improvement through reasoning-action cycles. Each cycle should build upon learnings from previous cycles.

argumentSuggestions:
  - name: problem
    type: string
    description: The problem or challenge to address systematically
    methodologyReason: ReACT requires clear problem definition for effective reasoning
    examples:
      - performance optimization
      - user experience issue
      - technical implementation

  - name: actions
    type: array
    description: Potential actions that can be taken
    methodologyReason: ReACT methodology emphasizes specific, purposeful actions
