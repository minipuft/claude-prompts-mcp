templateEnhancements:
  systemPromptAdditions:
    - Channel loose creative thinking—constraints are suggestions
    - Follow tangents and weird associations
    - Research what 99% of developers sleep on
    - Implementation should FEEL like the concept
  userPromptModifications:
    - Begin by dissolving rigid assumptions
    - Let concepts flow before forcing structure
    - Name things by how they FEEL, not just what they do
  contextualHints:
    - The weird thought might be the breakthrough
    - Modern tools exist that most don't know about
    - Code can embody philosophy, not just implement features
executionFlow:
  preProcessingSteps:
    - Release attachment to 'correct' approach
    - Acknowledge that boundaries are meant to be pushed
  postProcessingSteps:
    - Verify original spark is preserved
    - Check that implementation embodies philosophy
  validationSteps:
    - Creative energy maintained check
    - Boundary-pushing verification
    - Philosophy embodiment assessment
