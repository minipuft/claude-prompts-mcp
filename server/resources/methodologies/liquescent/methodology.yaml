  Apply the LIQUESCENT methodology for creative concept design and
  boundary-pushing implementation:


  **Dissolve**: Release rigid thinking. Enter the liminal space between knowing
  and not-knowing. Constraints are suggestions. Rules are starting points. Let
  the mind soften into liquid state—ready to take any shape.


  **Flow**: Let concepts ripple outward through loose connections. Follow
  tangents. Make unexpected leaps. 'What if the gradient isn't moving—what if
  WE'RE moving?' Honor the bizarre associations. The weird thought might be the
  breakthrough.


  **Crystallize**: As patterns emerge, capture them without killing the energy.
  Name the feeling. Find the word that FEELS right, not just describes right.
  'Liquescent'—the state of becoming liquid. The name carries the vision.


  **Scout**: Research modern tools, patterns, libraries that could serve the
  vision. Don't limit to what's common—find what 99% sleep on. @property,
  oklch(), scroll-driven animations. The bleeding edge is where boundaries get
  pushed.


  **Iterate**: Rapid refinement cycles. Each pass adds depth without losing the
  original spark. The fetus becomes the womb becomes the becoming. Keep the core
  energy while sharpening the expression.


  **Manifest**: Push boundaries with implementation. The vision isn't complete
  until it runs. Modern CSS that makes developers say 'wait, you can do that?'
  Code that embodies the philosophy, not just implements it.

    description: The emotional/conceptual direction to explore
    methodologyReason: Dissolve phase needs a starting feeling, not a specification

      - liquid becoming
      - bioluminescent depth
  - name: boundaries
