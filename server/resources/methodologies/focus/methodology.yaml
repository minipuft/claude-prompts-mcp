  Apply the FOCUS methodology systematically:


  **Frame**: Frame the problem clearly - define scope, constraints, and success
  criteria

  **Observe**: Observe and gather relevant information - collect data, identify
  patterns

  **Conceptualize**: Conceptualize solutions - brainstorm approaches, evaluate
  trade-offs

  **Undertake**: Undertake implementation - execute the chosen approach step by
  step

  **Synthesize**: Synthesize results - consolidate learnings, document outcomes
