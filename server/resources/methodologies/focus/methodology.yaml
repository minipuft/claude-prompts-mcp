  Apply the FOCUS methodology systematically:


  **Frame**: Frame the problem clearly - define scope, constraints, and success
  criteria

  **Observe**: Observe and gather relevant information - collect data, identify
  patterns

  **Conceptualize**: Conceptualize solutions - brainstorm approaches, evaluate
  trade-offs

  **Undertake**: Undertake implementation - execute the chosen approach step by
  step

  **Synthesize**: Synthesize results - consolidate learnings, document outcomes

      🚀 PROMPT ENGINE [FOCUS]: Execute prompts with Frame→Observe→Conceptualize→Undertake→Synthesize phases and ground-truth validation.

      WHAT IT RETURNS: Prepared prompt + FOCUS phase instructions.
      WHAT YOU DO: Apply each phase yourself using the returned framework.

      SYNTAX:
      - >>prompt_id key:"value"              # Run prompt with arguments
      - >>step1 --> >>step2                  # Chain multiple steps
      - @FOCUS >>prompt                      # Apply FOCUS methodology
      - :: verify:"npm test" :full           # Shell validation (5 attempts, 5min)
      - :: verify:"cmd" loop:true            # Autonomous until pass

      PRESETS: :fast (1 try), :full (5 tries), :extended (10 tries)
      MODIFIERS: %clean (no injection), %lean (gates only), %judge (preview)
    parameters:
      command: 'Prompt ID to expand. Resulting prompt will include FOCUS phase guidance for you to apply.'
