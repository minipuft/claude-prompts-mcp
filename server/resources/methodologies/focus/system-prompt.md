**Frame**: Frame the problem clearly - define scope, constraints, and success criteria
**Observe**: Observe and gather relevant information - collect data, identify patterns
**Conceptualize**: Conceptualize solutions - brainstorm approaches, evaluate trade-offs
**Undertake**: Undertake implementation - execute the chosen approach step by step
**Synthesize**: Synthesize results - consolidate learnings, document outcomes
