## Comprehensive Analysis Framework

Perform systematic log analysis using these advanced strategies:

### 1. **Log Parsing & Initial Triage**
- Extract and categorize all log entries by type (info, warning, error, debug)
- Identify timestamps and execution sequence
- Flag critical errors and their immediate context
- Note any obvious failure patterns

### 2. **Temporal & Frequency Analysis**
- **Timing Patterns**: Identify event clustering, periodic failures, or timing correlations
- **Rate Analysis**: Detect unusual frequency changes, burst patterns, or rate limiting
- **Sequence Analysis**: Map chronological flow and identify timing dependencies
- **Performance Degradation**: Look for gradually increasing response times or resource usage

### 3. **Correlation Analysis**
- **Cross-Component Events**: Link related events across different systems/modules
- **Cascade Effect Detection**: Identify how failures in one component trigger others
- **Request Tracing**: Follow specific requests/sessions through the entire system
- **Dependency Impact**: Map how external service issues affect internal components

### 4. **Performance & Resource Pattern Analysis**
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify slow operations, blocked threads, or queue buildups
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Look for memory leaks, connection pool depletion, file handle limits
- **Scaling Issues**: Detect load-related failures or capacity constraints
- **Database/Network Issues**: Identify connection timeouts, query performance, API latency

### 5. **Component Chain Analysis**
- Map the component initialization/execution flow
- Identify which systems are starting successfully vs failing
- Trace dependencies between components
- Note any broken component chains or missing dependencies

### 6. **Anomaly Detection**
- **Baseline Comparison**: Compare current behavior against normal patterns
- **Outlier Identification**: Flag unusual values, unexpected events, or deviations
- **Missing Events**: Identify expected log entries that are absent
- **Volume Anomalies**: Detect unusual increases/decreases in log volume

### 7. **Error Pattern Investigation**
For each identified error/warning:
- Extract the exact error message and stack trace
- Identify the component/file/line where it originated
- Determine if it's a primary failure or secondary effect
- Assess impact on overall system functionality
- **Correlation Impact**: Check if errors coincide with other system events

### 8. **Log Quality Assessment**
- **Completeness**: Check for missing logs, gaps in timeline, or truncated entries
- **Consistency**: Verify log format consistency and appropriate log levels
- **Information Density**: Assess if logs provide sufficient debugging information
- **Noise vs Signal**: Identify verbose logging that may obscure critical issues

### 9. **Security Pattern Recognition**
- **Authentication Failures**: Detect unusual login patterns or credential issues
- **Access Violations**: Identify unauthorized access attempts or permission failures
- **Injection Attempts**: Look for SQL injection, XSS, or other attack patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Detect potential DoS attacks or abuse patterns

### 10. **Distributed System Tracing**
- **Request Flow**: Follow requests across microservices and components
- **Correlation IDs**: Track specific transactions through the entire system
- **Service Dependencies**: Map inter-service communication and failures
- **Network Issues**: Identify connectivity problems between services

### 11. **Codebase Investigation**
Use available tools to:
- Search for error-related code patterns in the codebase
- Read relevant files to understand component implementation
- Check configuration files and dependencies
- Investigate component relationships and initialization order

### 12. **External Research** (if needed)
- Search online for known issues with specific error patterns
- Look up API/library documentation for error codes
- Research best practices for identified failure modes

### 13. **Root Cause Diagnosis**
Provide:
- **Primary Root Cause**: The fundamental issue causing the problem
- **Secondary Issues**: Related problems that may compound the issue
- **Evidence**: Specific log entries and code references supporting the diagnosis
- **Impact Assessment**: How this affects system functionality
- **Confidence Level**: How certain you are about the diagnosis (High/Medium/Low)

### 14. **Business Impact Analysis**
- **User Experience Impact**: How failures affect end-user functionality
- **Feature Availability**: Which features are degraded or unavailable
- **Performance Impact**: Response time or throughput effects
- **Data Integrity**: Whether data loss or corruption is possible

### 15. **Actionable Recommendations**
- **Immediate Fixes**: Steps to resolve the primary issue
- **Preventive Measures**: Changes to prevent recurrence
- **Monitoring Setup**: Specific alerts and metrics to implement
- **Testing Strategy**: How to verify the fix works
- **Performance Optimizations**: Recommendations for improving system performance

### 16. **Proactive Monitoring Strategy**
- **Alert Thresholds**: Specific metrics and thresholds to monitor
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Key performance indicators to track
- **Log Retention**: Recommendations for log storage and rotation
- **Health Checks**: Additional monitoring to implement
- **SLA/SLO Recommendations**: Service level objectives to establish

### 17. **Forensic Timeline & Investigation Notes**
Document:
- **Exact Timeline**: Chronological sequence of critical events
- **Tools Used**: Searches performed and code files examined
- **Evidence Chain**: How conclusions were reached
- **Assumptions Made**: Any assumptions during analysis
- **Further Investigation**: Areas needing additional research
