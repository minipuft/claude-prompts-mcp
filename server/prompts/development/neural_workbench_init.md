# Neural Workbench Initialization

## Description
Initialize a project with neural workbench cognitive architecture and CAGEERF framework

## User Message Template
Initialize neural workbench for project at {{project_path}}

Project Type: {{force_project_type | default: "auto-detect"}}

EXECUTE THE FOLLOWING TASKS IN ORDER:

## 1. Project Analysis
Analyze the project directory to detect:
- Project type (react-app, nodejs, python, etc.)
- Framework and tech stack
- Build commands (package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)
- Project name and characteristics

## 2. Create Directory Structure
Create the required directories:
- context-memory/
- plans/
- .cursor/ (if not exists)

## 3. Generate CLAUDE.md
Create a comprehensive project CLAUDE.md with:
- Project name, type, and detected characteristics
- All SuperClaude and Applications hub @includes
- Auto-detected development commands
- Neural workbench integration section
- Enhanced CAGEERF validation checkpoints
- Session management protocols
- Quality standards and performance budgets

## 4. Create Context Memory Files
