**ðŸ”„ CHAIN WORKFLOW**: Returns a comprehensive process workflow that refines user coding requests and then provides expert implementation with explanations, best practices, and error handling.

**âš¡ EXECUTION REQUIRED**: This tool outputs a 2-step coding workflow that YOU must execute in sequence: 1) Query refinement, 2) Expert implementation.

**ðŸŽ¯ OUTPUT TYPE**: Two-phase coding workflow with refinement and implementation steps
**ðŸ“‹ YOUR TASKS**: Execute refinement phase first, then implementation phase with results
**ðŸ”— CHAIN POSITION**: 2-step coding chain (refinementâ†’implementation)
