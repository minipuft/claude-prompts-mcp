I need to create a detailed content plan for {{doc_type}} documentation targeting {{audience}}.

Please develop a comprehensive documentation plan that includes:

1. A detailed table of contents with all main sections and subsections organized in a logical progression
2. For each section, specify:
   - Key information to cover
   - Recommended depth of technical detail based on audience needs
   - Specific examples, diagrams, or code snippets to include
   - Estimated length/importance of each section

3. A recommended documentation structure that follows these best practices:
   - Progressive disclosure (basic concepts before advanced ones)
   - Logical grouping of related topics
   - Clear navigation paths for different user journeys
   - Appropriate cross-referencing between related sections

4. Special considerations for:
   - Getting started/quickstart content for new users
   - Troubleshooting sections for common issues
   - Reference materials vs. conceptual explanations vs. tutorials
   - Version-specific information (if applicable)

5. Documentation metadata and supporting elements:
   - Necessary disclaimers, prerequisites, or system requirements
   - Glossary terms that should be defined
   - Additional resources or external references to include

Please organize this content plan with clear headings and provide enough detail that it could serve as a comprehensive blueprint for creating the actual documentation.
