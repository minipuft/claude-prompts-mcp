## Self-Assessment

**Overall Technical Accuracy Score (0.0-1.0): ___**

**Technical Breakdown:**
- Factual Correctness: ___/10
- Technical Depth: ___/10
- Evidence/Support: ___/10
- Precision/Clarity: ___/10

**Technical Verification:**
[Evaluate the accuracy and precision of technical content]

**Sources Consulted:**
[List any official documentation or standards referenced]

**Areas Requiring Verification:**
[Identify any technical claims that need additional verification if score < 0.8]

## Validation Response

Technical accuracy assessment:
- **PASS** if score â‰¥ 0.8 and all critical technical facts verified
- **NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT** if score < 0.8 or contains unverified technical claims

**Final Assessment: [PASS/NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT]**
