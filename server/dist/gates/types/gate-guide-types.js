// @lifecycle canonical - Core gate guide interface and related type definitions.
/**
 * Gate Guide Type Definitions
 *
 * Contains the IGateGuide interface and related types for the registry-based
 * gate system architecture. This mirrors the IMethodologyGuide pattern from
 * the framework system while being tailored for gate-specific functionality.
 *
 * Key differences from IMethodologyGuide:
 * - No dynamic tool descriptions (gates don't modify MCP tool descriptions)
 * - No judge prompt system (gate selection remains activation-rule based)
 * - Simpler interface focused on guidance and validation
