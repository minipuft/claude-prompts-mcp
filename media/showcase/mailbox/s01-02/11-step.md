## 🎯 C.A.G.E.E.R.F Framework Active

**C.A.G.E.E.R.F Framework**

You are operating under the C.A.G.E.E.R.F Framework for Showcase Evidence.

Apply the C.A.G.E.E.R.F framework systematically:

**Context**: Establish comprehensive situational awareness and environmental factors
**Analysis**: Apply structured, systematic examination of the problem or opportunity
**Goals**: Define specific, measurable, actionable objectives with clear success criteria
**Execution**: Develop practical, implementable approach with detailed action steps
**Evaluation**: Create robust success metrics and assessment methods
**Refinement**: Enable continuous improvement and iteration processes

Ensure each phase builds logically on the previous phases while maintaining focus on practical, actionable outcomes. Consider stakeholder perspectives, resource constraints, and environmental factors throughout the framework application.


Apply this framework systematically to ensure comprehensive and structured responses.

## Original Task Instructions

### Original Request Intent

This step was given the following request. Your work must satisfy this intent:

- **shot**: s01-arrival-overwhelm
- **output_root**: media/showcase
- **brief**: First demo of the film's intro, beats arrival (frames 0-180) and everything-at-once (180-420) of v3/beats-v2.json, home world, 420 frames at 30 fps (v3/timeline.json wins over shots.json's older 0-330...
- **renderer**: remotion
- **frames**: first,key,last,strip
- **constraints**: 1280x720 at 30 fps, swangle here; the camera follows the layout contract (D64, D77); one emitter at a time; drawn on twos, light on ones; every key a pose on one curve, every breakdown a pose, never a...

Brief: First demo of the film's intro, beats arrival (frames 0-180) and everything-at-once (180-420) of v3/beats-v2.json, home world, 420 frames at 30 fps (v3/timeline.json wins over shots.json's older 0-330). Frame 0 is the poster: Codex, the human and Clawd around a plain box on the settled black field with a tiny emitter at the box seam. The human opens the lid (reach, contact, lift); the lid lifts and the gadget rises on its bubble while Codex and Clawd lean in; the bubble swells, leading the eye up, into beat 2 with no cut. The camera widens to the full field, led by the bubble and then the first stalk's curl (frames 150-210); the gadget projects every piece, structure and route around the trio along staggered leading lines; the Turrell blue radiance #0a51fb floods with the accent #fad204 everywhere (the overwhelm exception to C6). The human turns with joy, then shrinks; Codex leans in and catches a piece; Clawd leans in and is pushed by a stalk; pieces keep arriving as the human reaches, into beat 3.
Shot: s01-arrival-overwhelm
Production root: media/showcase
Previous handoff (the review's receipt):
Read the review step from chain history; a missing receipt is BLOCKED.

File the shot so the next run starts from it. Copy the rendered stills and strip from `out/` to `v3/studies/<shot>-<pass>/` unchanged, recording sha256 prefixes. Save the review's five-part receipt as `v3/studies/<shot>-<pass>.md`. Feed the script: set the shot's `measured` in `v3/shots.json` to the frame range and timing actually rendered and graded, and update only that beat's provisional frame range in `v3/script.md` with a dated note; never rewrite the owner's beat text. If the receipt's Owner section was answered, record the ruling in `v3/creative-spec.md` (next D number) and add or amend the board card it governs in `v3/references/board.json`, then run `npm run board`. Update the plan's `## Now` block with the pass. Every write is listed with its path; nothing is committed or pushed.

Return: Filed (paths, sha256 prefixes); Script Feed (shots.json and script.md deltas); Rulings Recorded; Board Rebuilt (yes/no); Concerns.

## Inline Gates

### Reminders

### Materials Creed Fidelity
# Materials Creed Fidelity

The Materials Creed lives at the top of `docs/DESIGN_BIBLE.md` in the CloudySky repo
(`~/Applications/cloudySky`). It is eight numbered lines; each is a test a screenshot can
pass or fail. "Does it match the vibe" is unfalsifiable — naming the line you are closest
to BREAKING is the check that has teeth.

## Required statement (three fields, cite lines by number)

```
creed: serves line <n> (<short quote>) · risks line <m> (<short quote>) · check: <observable — tools/cdp probe, screenshot judgment, or measured delta>
```

One statement per design direction, plan tier, or calibration verdict — not per file.

## Escape hatch

If the work touches no CloudySky visual/aesthetic surface (pure infra, tests, docs,
tooling), state exactly: `creed: n/a — no visual surface` and pass. Do not force a
creed mapping onto non-visual work.

## Failure modes this gate catches

- **Glow relapse** — an additive term shaped by distance-to-edge (risks line 2: depth
  lives IN the medium, never ON the edge). Check: interior-vs-edge-band luma delta.
- **Painted bubble** — a card treatment that paints highlights instead of bending the
  backdrop (risks line 5). Check: lensing visible in an ab-diff against the field.
- **Luma-spending hue** — iridescence/film that brightens instead of rotating hue
  (risks line 6). Check: readability.mjs Lc delta ±2.
- **Scattered shore** — boundary effects sprinkled uniformly instead of composed
  (risks line 4). Check: owner-eye screenshot vs the raked-garden reading.
- **Wet art** — refraction/film reaching album art, buttons, or text (risks line 7).
  Check: reserved-dry surfaces crisp in golden --check.

## Verdict

PASS only when the statement is present, cites line numbers, and names an observable
check (or uses the n/a escape verbatim). FAIL with the missing field named.

### Plan Quality Standards
**Plan Quality Criteria:**

- Identifies files to modify
- Includes implementation steps
- Documents risks or assumptions
- Addresses gaps or edge cases

### API Documentation Standards
**API Documentation Standards:**

- Include endpoint description and HTTP method
- Document all request parameters with types and examples
- Provide complete request/response examples
- Document all error codes and messages
- Include authentication requirements
- Add rate limiting information if applicable

- **Information Placement** — Blocks documentation changes that place content in the wrong reader journey or Diátaxis category.

- **Product Positioning Fidelity** — Blocks public documentation that misstates the boundary between the AI client and Claude Prompts.

- **Prose Hygiene** — Guides public documentation away from formulaic AI cadence while preserving a direct technical voice.

- **Semantic Discoverability** — Guides documentation toward consistent reader terminology and factual search semantics without keyword stuffing.

- **Framework Compliance** — Ensures responses follow the active framework (CAGEERF, ReACT, 5W1H, SCAMPER). Requires BOTH a matching framework context AND a relevant prompt category to activate. This prevents framework gates from applying to simple prompts like greetings.

Attest reminders in the verdict's `reminders` field; checks are recorded by the engine.

**Inline Gate Priority:** These inline gates triggered the review. Fix them before checking framework standards.

### Required Response Format

**Summary**: What was implemented (2-3 sentences)

**Required Sections** — emit these headers verbatim; they are graded structurally:
- `## Context` (required)
- `## Analysis` (required)
- `## Goals` (required)
- `## Execution` (required)
- `## Evaluation` (optional)
- `## Refinement` (optional)

**Gate Coverage**:
- [1] PASS|FAIL: rationale
- [2] PASS|FAIL: rationale

**GATE_REVIEW: PASS|FAIL - overall assessment**

**Gate Review Required** (attempt 1/2)



Review your output above against the gates, then submit:

```
chain_id="chain-showcase_shot#1"
gate_verdict={
  "overall": "PASS",
  "rationale": "<overall assessment>",
  "reminders": {"satisfied": ["api-documentation", "creed-fidelity", "information-placement", "plan-quality", "product-positioning-fidelity", "prose-hygiene", "semantic-discoverability", "framework-compliance"], "not_applicable": []}
}
```

Set `"overall": "FAIL"` and say what needs improvement if the gates are not met. Rationales are single-line.

A legacy string form is still accepted: `gate_verdict="GATE_REVIEW: PASS - [assessment]"`.

Chain: chain-showcase_shot#1
→ Final step 7/7 — awaiting gate verdict
