Transform your AI assistant experience from scattered prompts to a **truly intelligent execution engine** that automatically understands and optimally executes any prompt across any MCP-compatible platform.

## 🚀 Revolutionary Interactive Prompt Management

**🎯 The Future is Here: Manage Your AI's Capabilities FROM WITHIN the AI Conversation**

This isn't just another prompt server – it's a **living, breathing prompt ecosystem** that evolves through natural conversation with your AI assistant. Imagine being able to:

```bash
# 🗣️ Create new prompts by talking to your AI
"Hey Claude, create a new prompt called 'code_reviewer' that analyzes code for security issues"
→ Claude creates, tests, and registers the prompt instantly

# ✏️ Refine prompts through conversation
"That code reviewer prompt needs to also check for performance issues"
→ Claude modifies the prompt and hot-reloads it immediately

# 🔍 Discover and iterate on your prompt library
>>listprompts
→ Browse your growing collection, then ask: "Improve the research_assistant prompt to be more thorough"

# 🧠 Execute prompts with zero configuration - system auto-detects everything
>>content_analysis my content
→ Automatic semantic analysis detects workflow type, applies quality gates, executes perfectly
```

**🌟 Why This Changes Everything:**

- **🧠 True Intelligence**: System understands prompts like a human - no configuration needed
- **🔄 Self-Evolving System**: Your AI assistant literally builds and improves its own capabilities in real-time
- **🎮 Zero Friction**: Never configure execution modes, quality gates, or headers - everything just works
- **⚡ Instant Perfection**: Create → Auto-detect → Execute optimally in one seamless flow
- **🌱 Learning System**: Detection accuracy improves through usage - gets smarter over time

This is what **truly intelligent AI infrastructure** looks like – where the system understands intent as naturally as reading human language.
